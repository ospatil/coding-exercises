# Mathematical preliminaries

## Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions

### Arithmetic Progression:

Consider the sequence $2, 4, 6, 8, 10$.
$a = 2$ (first term)
$d = 2$ (common difference)
We can write above sequence as $a+d, a+2d, ...., a+(n-1)d$.

Sum of terms =
$avg = sum/n$
$sum = avg * n$
For evenly spaced terms, the average is $(FT + LT)/2 * n$
$\therefore sum = n/2* (a + a + (n-1)d)$
$= n/2(2a+(n - 1)d)$

### Geometric Progression

Consider the sequence $2, 4, 8, 16, 32$.
$a = 2$ (first term)
$r = 2$ (common ration)

We can write the sequence as $ar, ar^2, ...., ar^{n-1}$.

$sum = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$

## Quadratic Equations

Consider the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

Roots of the equation are the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation. A quadratic equation will have two roots.

$D (discriminant) = b^2 - 4ac$

The two roots are:
$x = \frac{-b \pm sqrt(b^2 -4ac)}{2a}$

if $D < 0$, imaginary roots
$D = 0$, two equal roots
$D > 0$, two distinct roots

### Mean and Median

Mean
: Add up all the given data and divide by number of data entries.

Median
: The middle number. Found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle. If there are two middle numbers, take the mean of those two.

### Prime number

It's a number only divisible by $1$ and itself.
First few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 7, 11$.

Every prime number can be represented in form of $6n+1$ or $6n-1$ except $2$ and $3$. where n is a natural number:
For example: $5$ can be represented $(6*1) - 1$.

$2$ and $3$ are the only consecutive natural numbers that are prime.

### LCM and HCF

Factors
: All numbers that divide a number completely are called factors of a
number.

Example: $24$ is completely divisible by $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24$.
All these numbers are factors of $24$ and $24$ is called multiple of each of these.

LCM
: The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number other than 0 that's multiple of each number.

Example: LCM of $4$ and $6$
Multiples of $4$: $4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...$
Multiples of $6$: $6, 12, 18, 24, ...$
Common multiples: $12, 24$
LCM = $12$

HCF
: Highest common factor of two or more given numbers is the highest number
which exactly divides all the numbers.

Example: HCF of $12$ and $16$
Factors of $12$: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$
Factors of $16$: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$
Common Factors: $1, 2, 4$
HCF: $4$

### Factorials

Factorial of a +ve integer $n$
: Product of all +ve integers less than or equal to $n$

It's denoted by $n!$.

Example: $5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120$
i.e. $n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1$

$0! = 1$

### Permutation and Combinations

Permutation
: Arrangement of $r$ things that can be done out of total $n$ things.

$^n P_r = n!/(n-r)!$

Combination
: Selection of $r$ things that can be done out of total $n$ things.

$^n C_r = n!/r!(n-r)!$

### Modular Arithmetic

* The remainder obtained after the division operation on tow operands is known as *modulo* operation.
* Modulo operator is %.

Example: $7\%2 = 1$, $17\%3 = 2$
